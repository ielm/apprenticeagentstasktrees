This method is called after each iteration of construct_tree. It attempts to determine which of its two
possible parents a questioned node belongs to, as well as comparing the order of children in nodes representing
the same event and determining whether those children are parallel or sequential.

def disambiguate(questioned_tree, known_tree):
(Can be called with only one tree, in which case that will be used for both)
	for each questioned node in the questioned tree:
		for each non-questioned node in the known tree:
			if the nodes have the same main event:
				let "question" be the questioned node, "answer" the non-questioned node,
				and "other" the node that the questioned node is questioned with
				
				make a partial mapping from the children of answer to the children of other
				(with the criterion that same_main_event holds or that the nodes represent the same action)
				
				for each child of answer that is mapped to a child of other,
					remove that child from other
					
				remove remaining children of other from question
				
	for each non-questioned node in one tree:
		for each non-questioned node in the other tree:
			if they have the same main event:
				compare the orderings of their children and update their child relationship matrices accordingly
