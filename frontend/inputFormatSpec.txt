Each input file is an array of arrays of nodes. Each internal array represents
one stage of the growth of the tree represented by the input file.

Each node contains, minimally:
  - name (string)
  - children (array of strings)
  - childMatrix (2d array of strings)
and may also contain any other fields, which will be copied verbaitm into the
frontend's internal representation for potential use.

The child matrix should be a square matrix with rows and columns corresponding
to each node listed in the children array, in the same order. Its elements
should be one of "<", ">", or "=".

Each stage of the tree's growth need not reproduce the entire tree structure,
only the delta from the previous stage. That is, any node that has changed only
needs to list its name and any properties that have changed, and unchanged nodes
do not need to be listed at all. (Newly added nodes have all of their properties
changed, and so must be listed in full.)

For example, the following sequence:

    A             A                 D
                  |                 |
              ---------             |
              B       C             A
                                    |
                              --------------
                              B     C      E

could be represented as such (ignoring the childMatrix field for now):

[
  [
    {
      "name": "A",
      "children": []
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "name": "A",
      "children": ["B", "C"]
    },
    {
      "name": "B",
      "children": []
    },
    {
      "name": "C",
      "children": []
    }
  ],
  [
    {
      "name": "D",
      "children": ["A"]
    },
    {
      "name": "A",
      "children": ["B", "C", "E"]
    },
    {
      "name": "E",
      "children": []
    }
  ]
]

This is not a strict requirement, however, and each stage can include the entire
tree if that is more convenient to generate.
